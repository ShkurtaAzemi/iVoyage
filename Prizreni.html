It is widely considered that the stones used to build the 
mosque were taken from nearby Saint Archangels Monastery, 
In fact, parts of the former monastery can be seen in the 
mosque. Hasan Kaleshi, an Albanian historian, sustained in
1972 that Sofi Sinan Pasha couldn't have possibly ordered 
any monastery destruction as this was impossible without a
Sultan decree, rather, he ordered the use of the spare stones
to a better deed as ordered by the Sultan.

This is the most significant monument in the city. It was built in 1973 by the architect Bogdan Bogdanovic. 
It is perched on the so-called miners hill in northern Mitrovica. Two columns holding a mining cart represent
 the mining tradition of the city. Mitrovica is well known for its Trepca Mines. The monument was dedicated to
 the miners of the city (Albanian and Serbian partisans), who lost their lives during World War II. It was designed
 to represent the overcoming of national divisions between Albanians and Serbs and to bear witness to the peaceful 
 coexistence between the two communities in post-war Yugoslavia. Now the monument has lost its meaning and it can be
 seen as an object of indifference on both sides of the city.
